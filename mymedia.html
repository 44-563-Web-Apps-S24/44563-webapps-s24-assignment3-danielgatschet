            My Favorite Song
        </h2>
        <p>
            My favorite song right now is "Hold The Line" by Toto. The reason it is my favorite song right now is
            because of how much I love the piano in this song. It is just too groovy to ignore
        </p>

            My Favorite Movie
        </h2>
        <p>
            My all time favorite movie is Forrest Gump. This movie has always made me laugh and has always made me
            cry. I just can't stop watching this movie whenever it comes on. It will always be one of my favorites.
